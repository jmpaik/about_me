<h1>Hi, I'm Blue Toad!</h1>

<div>
<h3>A brief background...</h3>
<p>Born and raised in Seattle, WA. Obtained an undergraduate degree from the University of Washington and a graduate degree from the University of Illinois. Enjoys playing golf, drums, and with his baby daughter. Some interesting facts about him include living in various cities like New York City, Chicago, and Washington DC. One of his most embarrassing moments involve a bird pooping on his head while playing golf. That same day he won a very big poker tournament with a Royal Flush as a final 'ALL IN'. The moral of his embarrassing story is that a bird pooping on your head is good luck.<p/>
